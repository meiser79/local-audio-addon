# published, for attaching to a GitHub Release.
#
# A Docker user who downloads it gets a file that pulls a released image rather than compiling
# the player from source, and gets it with everything the checked-in file already carries: the
# host network namespace, `/dev/snd`, the commented Host-Avahi bind mount and the SENDSPIN_*
# block with its prose. Generated at release time from that one file rather than kept as a second
# copy, so the two cannot drift.
#
# Testable rather than a `sed` inside release.yml, because release.yml runs only on a tag: an
# inline transform is first exercised by a real release, and docker-compose.yml is a file that
# ordinary pull requests edit. Turning `build: .` into a block `build:` with a `context:` under
# it is an entirely reasonable change that would leave nothing to substitute, and the pull
# request making it should be the thing that goes red.
#
# Needs: bash, sed and grep.
